# Portfolio & Blog for my website ... and is free

Hi, I share with you my source code for my personal website.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

## Start the built-in web server

**Download Symfony CLI**

Make sure you have [Symfony CLI installed](https://symfony.com/download)
and then run:

```
symfony serve
```

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`

**Alternative Solutions**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8080`

Have fun!
